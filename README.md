# Aircall - iOS Technical test

  
Hi everyone! Thank you for your time reviewing my code challenge :)
  

### Stack

- I have chosen to go with SwiftUI and a little bit of Combine, to make something a little bit different than the typical UIKit frame. I've heared that you are using it at Aircall, so it helped my decision.
- MVVM pattern, structured by Modules (views)
- No third party libraries used, as I don't think they are needed for this project


I tried to make the project as structured as possible, even if some things may seem a bit 'over developed' for the small project that it actually is. I tried to build something that can be scalable if the app grows. Note that I used the endpoint "/activities/:id" because it was in the readme, but I don't find it very useful as it doesn't return any other information than the full list of calls.

The most challenging aspect for me was going back to work in SwiftUI, since I don't with it on my daily basis for a long time. It would be more easy (and probably better, overall)  to go with UIKit, as I am used to work with it, but I wanted to take advantage of the challenge to catch up with SwiftUI. Also, I am quite happy with UI testing added to the app, as they cover all the needed features for the project.

Taking into account the requirements, with more time I would implement more 'not happy' paths for testing and for the app itself. I also see the project as a perfect example where a local database would be useful, to manage 'archive' calls or offline functionality. 

It would be a pleasure for me to talk about the project with any of you. And once again, thank you very much for your time.

For any doubt, don't hesitate to contact me at marcos.sabaris@gmail.com
